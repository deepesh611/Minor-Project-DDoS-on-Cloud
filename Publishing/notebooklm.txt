ABSTRACT Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks present a significant threat to cloud infrastructures, resulting in service disruptions, compromised user experiences, and potential financial losses. These sophisticated attacks overwhelm resources by exploiting vulnerabilities, leading to system downtime and performance degradation. This work proposes an advanced, autonomous defense system driven by Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for real-time detection, mitigation, and recovery from DDoS attacks in cloud environments. The solution incorporates an Incremental Learning Model that enables continuous adaptation to emerging threats without requiring complete retraining, offering a robust and self-healing mechanism. The system efficiently identifies anomalies, dynamically filters malicious traffic via Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and employs honeypots for early pattern identification. Furthermore, resilience is enhanced through auto-scaling and load balancing mechanisms to maintain continuous operation during an attack. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, demonstrating that the Incremental Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with 98.16% accuracy and the lowest False Positive Rate (FPR) of 2.28% in classification tasks. This system strengthens the security and reliability of cloud environments by providing a scalable and cost-effective defense.

I. INTRODUCTION
The current digital era faces a persistent and complex threat landscape characterized by continuously evolving and increasingly sophisticated forms of malware, including viruses, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These malicious software variants are designed to exploit system vulnerabilities, disrupt operations, and inflict financial damage. Among the most critical threats are Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which exploit the extensive accessibility and high network capacity of cloud infrastructure, making these environments prime targets. DDoS attacks lead to overwhelming server resources with illegitimate traffic, resulting in service disruptions, downtime, and financial loss.
The shift towards cloud computing has increased organizational reliance on these infrastructures for critical applications and data storage. This dependency necessitates a robust defense mechanism, as traditional DDoS protection methods, such as basic IP blacklisting or rate limiting, are often static and inadequate for dynamically responding to evolving attack patterns and high traffic volumes. The inability of conventional methods to differentiate intelligently between legitimate and malicious traffic, especially against zero-day or low-rate DDoS attacks, highlights a significant research gap.
To address the limitations of static defense, this project proposes an adaptive and autonomous DDoS defense solution. The system leverages advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for accurate, real-time anomaly detection and dynamic traffic filtering. Key contributions of the proposed system include:
1. Implementation of high-performing ML/DL algorithms for accurate, real-time traffic anomaly detection.
2. Development of an Incremental Learning Model to ensure continuous adaptation to new attack vectors without resource-intensive retraining.
3. Integration of multi-layered defenses, including Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and honeypots, to enhance resilience and provide early detection.
4. Design of a highly resilient server architecture utilizing a Main/Backup server setup with Wake-on-LAN (WoL) capability to ensure high availability and resource efficiency.
The overall goal is to provide a self-healing, scalable, and cost-effective solution that ensures uninterrupted service delivery in cloud environments.
II. RELATED WORK
A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals various strategies and challenges associated with DDoS defense in evolving network environments.
A. Evolution of DDoS Attacks and Their Impact DDoS attacks have transitioned from simple volumetric floods to sophisticated, multi-vector assaults, complicating defense strategies in highly resilient cloud infrastructures. Successful attacks can degrade service reliability and cause cascading failures across interconnected resources. Addressing this demands adaptive detection methods capable of handling known and emerging threats in real-time.
B. Existing DDoS Mitigation Techniques and Their Limitations Conventional mitigation techniques, such as blacklisting and rate limiting, often lack the intelligence required to accurately distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic, particularly in large-scale cloud systems. Static, signature-based detection systems struggle against novel or polymorphic DDoS attacks. Due to these limitations, conventional methods are deemed insufficient for modern cloud environments.
C. Machine Learning for DDoS Anomaly Detection Machine learning algorithms, particularly those focused on anomaly detection, have shown promise by analyzing vast amounts of traffic data to identify unusual patterns indicative of an attack. Supervised algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees, are frequently used to classify benign and malicious traffic. However, their effectiveness can be constrained by reliance on labeled data, leading to a growing preference for unsupervised and semi-supervised models in adaptive detection frameworks.
D. Deep Learning Approaches for Enhanced Detection and Response Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enable complex, multi-layered analysis of network traffic. Studies, such as those conducted by Sahi et al. (2017), indicate that DL models can improve detection accuracy in high-volume environments by capturing signatures missed by simpler ML models. The main trade-off, however, is the requirement for extensive computational resources and training time. Hybrid systems combining DL with lightweight ML are often explored to balance speed and accuracy.
E. Autonomous Defense Systems and Incremental Learning The move towards autonomous defense systems integrates ML and automation to enable systems to detect, respond to, and recover from attacks without manual intervention. Self-adapting architectures that automatically adjust resources (e.g., load balancing and auto-scaling) and incorporate incremental learning capabilities are critical for maintaining defense effectiveness against evolving threats. This continuous learning approach enhances scalability and reduces the need for frequent human oversight.
F. Effectiveness of Honeypots and Multi-layered Defense Mechanisms Honeypots serve as decoy systems used within multi-layered defense strategies to detect early signs of DDoS activity and analyze attacker behavior. When coupled with mechanisms like WAFs and network segmentation, honeypots enhance both detection accuracy and system resilience. The integration of these layered mechanisms with adaptive ML models is crucial for comprehensive defense against sophisticated attacks.
The current research gap identifies a need for systems that combine the real-time efficiency of lightweight models with the adaptability of incremental learning to handle zero-day attacks, minimize high computational costs, and unify multi-layered defenses like WAFs and honeypots within a single, autonomous architecture.
III. THE PROPOSED AUTONOMOUS DEFENSE SYSTEM
The proposed autonomous system, titled "System Defence Against DDoS: Detection, Mitigation, and Recovery", employs a hybrid approach leveraging ML, DL, and incremental learning to provide resilient protection for cloud infrastructure.
A. Methodology and System Architecture The system's primary goal is to provide real-time detection while continuously adapting to new attack patterns. The architecture relies on two key components: the main server, which processes traffic and runs detection algorithms, and the backup server, which remains on standby for continuous availability. The system architecture is visualized in Figure 8 and Figure 9.
B. Data Collection and Feature Engineering The system processes network traffic characterized by several key features, including:
• Packet Count Metrics: pktcount, pktrate.
• Byte Metrics: bytecount, byteperflow, tx_kbps, rx_kbps, tot_kbps.
• Flow Information: flows.
Data preprocessing is critical and involves two steps: Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder for categorical information (Protocol, Source/Destination addresses, Switch identifiers) and Feature normalization using StandardScaler. The normalization formula is applied to handle non-numeric values by substituting them with 0.0.
C. Core Detection Models The system implements a three-tier model architecture:
1. Deep Learning Model (DDoS Detector): This utilizes a four-layer neural network with decreasing neuron counts (input_dim $\rightarrow$ 64 $\rightarrow$ 32 $\rightarrow$ 16 $\rightarrow$ 2). It includes Batch normalization for stability, ReLU activation, and Dropout (0.3) for regularization.
2. Random Forest Classifier: This ensemble model consists of 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100). It uses a maximum depth of 10 (max_depth=10) to prevent overfitting, alongside optimized leaf and split parameters.
3. Incremental Random Forest: Designed for continuous learning, this model utilizes warm_start=True to support dynamic updates, enabling seamless adaptation to evolving threat patterns.
D. Server Architecture and Resilience The robust server architecture includes a Main Server and a Backup Server:
• Main Server: Handles all incoming network traffic and runs the combined ML/DL/incremental learning detection algorithms. It implements immediate mitigation strategies like traffic filtering upon detection.
• Backup Server: Operates in standby mode, continuously monitoring the main server's health. It automatically takes over if the main server fails or is overwhelmed, ensuring continuous availability.
• Power Efficiency (WoL): The backup server employs Wake-on-LAN (WoL) technology, allowing it to remain in a low-power state while on standby. This power-efficient approach minimizes energy consumption during idle periods, contributing to cost-effectiveness.
IV. MITIGATION AND RECOVERY MECHANISMS
The system's defense mechanism is fully autonomous, encompassing incremental training and dynamic recovery protocols.
A. Incremental Learning Methodology The training process uses a multi-phase approach. After an initial training phase for the foundational models, the Incremental Learning Phase takes over. In this phase, the partial_fit method is used on the Incremental Random Forest model to update it with new scaled data (X_scaled, y). This feature is crucial for adapting to concept drift and emerging threats without the computational cost of full retraining.
B. Traffic Filtering and Blocking The recovery mechanism dynamically responds to excessive traffic through a continuous monitoring script.
1. Traffic Monitoring: The script monitors incoming network traffic on a specified interface, comparing the received bytes against a predefined threshold over one-minute intervals. Exceeding this threshold is interpreted as a potential DDoS attack.
2. IP Identification: If excessive traffic is detected, network analysis tools, such as tcpdump, are used to identify the specific IP address responsible for the highest volume of malicious incoming traffic.
3. Blocking: Once identified, the offending IP address is automatically blocked using iptables, immediately mitigating the impact of the potential DDoS attack and allowing legitimate traffic flow to resume.
C. Server Recovery To ensure system recovery and availability, the script includes measures to manage the network interface. This involves temporarily disconnecting the network interface and then reconnecting it after a brief pause, helping the system recover from the attack and resume normal operations. All significant events, including traffic detection and IP blocking, are logged for post-event analysis. The visual representation of the server status during an attack is detailed in Figure 10 (Main Server Status) and Figure 11 (Backup Server Status).
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The proposed system was evaluated based on standard performance metrics derived from its classification capabilities.
A. Performance Evaluation The system continuously monitors accuracy metrics, including: rf_accuracy, dl_accuracy, incremental_accuracy, and ensemble_accuracy. Furthermore, False Positive Rate (FPR) analysis is conducted using the confusion matrix derived from the true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true positives (TP).
$$ \text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN} \text{ if } (FP + TN) > 0 \text{ else } 0 \text{} $$
B. Comparative Classification Performance The performance of the models demonstrated significant variations in accuracy and FPR.
1. Deep Learning Model: Achieved an accuracy of 72.61% but suffered from a substantially higher FPR of 40.49%.
2. Random Forest Model: Achieved better performance with an accuracy of 96.89% and an FPR of 4.56%.
3. Incremental Random Forest Model: This model consistently outperformed the others, yielding the highest accuracy of 98.16% and the lowest FPR of 2.28%.
The results show a marked improvement in detection accuracy compared to previous and base models, validating the efficacy of the incremental adjustments and refined methodology. The improved model’s performance enhances reliability and reduces false positives, thereby creating a more robust detection system. This superiority of the Incremental Random Forest model highlights the benefits of using an adaptive ensemble technique for DDoS detection.
C. System Optimization and Monitoring The system employs Batch Processing (using chunk_size = 1000) for testing and Data Augmentation using SMOTE (smote.fit_resample) during training to handle data imbalances. Visual monitoring (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) illustrates key performance aspects such as Model Accuracy Over Time, Final Performance Metrics, Numeric Values of Accuracy and FPR, and False Positive Rates.
The architectural resilience is verified by monitoring service status during attacks (Figure 13 and Figure 14). Figure 14 demonstrates the maintenance of service availability even when the main server is compromised due to an attack.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Cloud infrastructures face continuous threats from evolving Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This project successfully developed a resilient, autonomous defense system utilizing a hybrid methodology encompassing ML, DL, WAFs, and honeypots, specifically designed for real-time detection, mitigation, and recovery. The introduction of the Incremental Learning Model proved highly effective, achieving an accuracy of 98.16% and a False Positive Rate of 2.28%, surpassing individual traditional classifiers. Furthermore, the incorporation of a high-availability server architecture using WoL ensures minimal downtime and resource efficiency. The system effectively bridges the gap between static traditional defenses and the requirement for scalable, adaptive security solutions.
Future work aims to significantly extend the capabilities and applicability of the system:

• Threat Landscape Broadening: Expand the system’s detection capabilities beyond DDoS to include other attack vectors, such as SQL injection, phishing, and malware distribution.
• Cloud Integration and Scalability: Explore integration with cloud-native security solutions like AWS Shield or Azure DDoS Protection and deployment within a serverless architecture to enhance scalability and reduce operational costs.
• Real-World Validation: Conduct pilot programs and testing in live environments to refine the models against actual attack conditions and establish benchmarks aligned with industry standards.
